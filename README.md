# Islandora Comic Book Archive Generator

## Introduction

This module generates [comic book archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book_archive) files for paged content object such as books and newspaper issues. These objects can then be read offline in comic book reader applications.

## Requirements

* [Islandora](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora)
* [Islandora Book Solution Pack](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_book), [Islandora Newspaper Solution Pack](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solution_pack_newspaper), or some other solution pack that supports Islandora objects that contain paged content.

## Status

Just an idea at the moment, but when complete, the module will display a tab in the public display of objects of book or newspaper content types that lets the usere download for offline reading. When selected, the usere gets to choose a comic book archive format (there are several) and when they hit "Submit", the pages of the object are added to a single archive file the user can download for offline reading.
